# Open-Inventory

### Version: 
1.0

### Designation:
Open-source

### License: 
GNU General Public License v3.0

### Description:
Open Inventory is a simple, open-source solution to inventory management, written in Python. It is, at the time of this writing, being developed as part of my Senior Design Project at the American University of Nigeria (AUN), for the Fall 2018 semester.

### Languages:
* Python (user interface, programming logic, business rules)
* SQLite (database)

### Modules, Extensions & Libraries:
* tkinter (GUI)
* Pmw (GUI)
* webbrowser (link to GitHub)
* re (regular expressions)
* sqlite3 (database connectivity)
* pandas (data science)
* matplotlib (data science)

### Lines of Code:
* 2800+

### Platform Dependencies:
* **Hardware:** PC
* **Operating System:** Windows

### Future Implementations:
Circumstances permitting, Open Inventory will eventually be migrated to a Python-based web-development framework -- preferably Django -- which will allow for far more features and flexibility.

### For Developers:
The root file for the application is ```open-inventory.py```. With Python (at least 3.5) installed on your system, run it in Command Prompt/Terminal (code may need to be tweaked a bit for Linux) from wherever the file is saved, using 
```bash
  python open-inventory.py
  ```
  No other system requirements except Python. SQLite database comes with Python.
